Kitchenware Image Classification Project
Overview
This project focuses on building a high-performance image classification model capable of distinguishing between four types of kitchenware: cups, knives, scissors, and spoons. We have used various machine learning and deep learning techniques, including CNNs, MobileNetV2, and HOG-SVM classifiers, and incorporated reinforcement learning to enhance the model's performance using real-time feedback.
